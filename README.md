# SystemCompiler
Project to bring systems and IP development and collaboration to the 21st century

The idea is to have an interchange format for all of the IP used in a system and be able to effectively manage it with all vendors over the cloud.

Specific IP protected channels to each vendor representing IP will have to be opened.
